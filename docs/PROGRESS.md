## Known Issues & Lessons Learned

### Resolved Issues

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bot crashes on every message | Cloudflare `SqlStorage.one()` throws on empty results (doesn't return null) | Replaced all `.one()` with `.toArray()` + length check in 6 files | `38cb19e` |
| Workers AI always falls back to DeepSeek | Qwen3-30B-A3B returns OpenAI chat completion format (`choices[0].message.content`) not simple `{ response }` | Added `extractResponseText()` handling both formats | `0375de1` |
| TypeScript CI fails | `BaseAiTextGenerationModels` type doesn't exist in Cloudflare types | Used `(ai as any).run()` with explicit response type cast | `a47d625` |
| New PendingAction values not in union type | `conversation.ts` PendingAction didn't include new loan states | Added `confirm_loan`, `loan_fill_missing`, `loan_edit_select`, `loan_edit_field` to PendingAction | `6b439a0` |
| User types new intent during active wizard → confusing validation error | Conversation state takes priority; wizard tries to parse "hutang di warung..." as a number | Added `looksLikeNewIntent()` keyword heuristic guard — warns user to /batal first | `d0e35a5` |

### Active Notes

- **`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`** must be set in GitHub repo Settings → Secrets for auto-deploy.
- **Durable Object SQLite**: Always use `.toArray()` instead of `.one()` when a query might return 0 rows.
- **Workers AI response format**: Newer models (Qwen3) return OpenAI-compatible chat completion format, not the simple `{ response }` format shown in Cloudflare docs.
- **CI runs twice per push to PR branch**: GitHub Actions fires both `push` and `pull_request` events. Can optimize later by restricting `push` trigger to `main` only.
- **Loan UX design**: Conversational-first (AI extraction → confirm) is much better than step-by-step wizards for chat-based interfaces. Users provide most info in one message.
- **Payment recording**: Fuzzy platform name matching (case-insensitive substring) works well for natural language ("bayar shopee" matches "Shopee Pinjam").
- **Late fee calculation**: Duplicated in `payment.ts` (private) and `late-fee-calc.ts` (exported). Could refactor to shared utility later.
- **Dashboard**: `/hutang` shortcut command bypasses AI — saves Neurons for a purely read-only operation.
- **Alert throttling**: Using `_alert_meta` key-value table with timestamp. 6-hour cooldown prevents spam while ensuring driver sees warnings at least twice per active day.
- **Penalty calculator**: `/denda` also bypasses AI. Shows projected penalties based on current date.
- **Monthly summary**: `/ringkasan` bypasses AI. Routes `view_report` AI intent to monthly summary. Supports month argument.
- **Payoff progress**: `/progres` bypasses AI. Shows all loans (active + paid_off) for full historical picture. Sorted by completion % (closest to payoff first). Projected payoff date uses simple months-remaining calculation.
- **All 5 shortcut commands** (`/hutang`, `/denda`, `/ringkasan`, `/progres`, `/help`) bypass AI → zero Neuron cost for read-only operations.

## Development Workflow

**For each feature:**
1. Create branch: `feat/f{ID}-{name}` from `main`
2. Push code to feature branch
3. CI auto-checks TypeScript types
4. Create PR to `main`
5. Merge → auto-deploy to Cloudflare Workers
